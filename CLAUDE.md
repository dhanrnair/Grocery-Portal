# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Express + Vite (middleware mode, HMR) on http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # Vite build of the React app into dist/
npm start          # Production: Express serves /api and dist/
npm run db:setup   # Create tables, seed missing rows (idempotent)
```

No test suite or linter is configured. Verify by building and calling the API (`curl localhost:3000/api/health`).

Node 22+ required (scripts use `node --env-file-if-exists=.env`). If `node` isn't found, try `export PATH=~/.local/node/bin:$PATH`.

`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` must also be set (`server/auth.js` exits without it).

`DATABASE_URL` (Neon connection string) must be set via `.env` (git-ignored) or the host environment; `server/db.js` exits at import if it is missing.

## Domain: Grocery Portal

Catalog + stock pattern (products, orders, order_items). Sign-in is required to place or cancel an order.

- `createOrder` locks the product rows `FOR UPDATE` in sorted id order, checks stock, snapshots name/unit/price into `order_items`, then decrements stock. Prices, delivery fee (`deliveryFor`: free over $35, else $3.99) and totals come only from the server; the client sends product ids and quantities (max 20 per product, duplicate lines merged).
- `cancelOrder(code, userId)` is owner-scoped (wrong owner = same 404 as unknown code), sets `status='cancelled'` and restocks. Cancelling is not undoable.
- Public: product browsing and `POST /api/orders/lookup` (code + email, read-only). `GET /api/my/orders` is session-scoped; there is no list-all endpoint.
- Cart lives in `localStorage` (`src/context/CartContext.jsx`); a successful order navigates to `/my-orders`.
- Order codes look like `GRO-XXXXXXXX`. Seed data is in `server/db/seed.js`; editing a row there does not change an existing DB row.
- Known gaps: demo only (no payments), no email verification or password reset, no admin/staff role or stock management UI.

## Deploy

`render.yaml` is a Render Blueprint (one web service, health check `/api/health`). Build command runs `npm ci --include=dev && npm run db:setup && npm run build`; `DATABASE_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` are entered in the Render dashboard.

## Architecture

Single deployable app: one Node process serves the API and the front end on one port. Keep it that way; `vite.config.js` exists only for the React plugin and the build.

- `server/index.js` mounts `/api`, then embeds Vite (middleware mode) in dev or serves `dist/` with an SPA fallback (`/{*splat}`, Express 5 syntax) in production.
- `server/api.js`: routes and request validation. Errors with a `status` return their message; anything else is logged and returned as a generic 500. Express 5 forwards rejected async handlers, so routes don't need try/catch.
- `server/repo.js`: all SQL. Cast numeric columns with `::float8` so they arrive as numbers.
- `server/db.js`: Neon `Pool` (WebSocket) plus `withTransaction(fn)`. Pool, not the HTTP driver, because multi-step writes need real transactions.
- `server/db/schema.sql` is idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`; there is no migration tool, so changing an existing table needs an appended `ALTER ... IF NOT EXISTS`. Seeds use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so editing seed data does not update existing rows.
- `shared/rules.js` is imported by both server and browser (validation, money helpers). Keep it free of Node/browser-only APIs.
- `src/services/api.js` is the only place the browser calls the server. Server validation errors arrive with `err.fields`.
- Auth: Better Auth (email + password) is mounted at `/api/auth/*` in `server/index.js` **before** any body parser; config in `server/auth.js` on the shared `pool`. Its tables (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`, camelCase quoted columns) are in `schema.sql`. In routes use `getSession(req)` (null for guests) or `requireUser(req)` (401) from `server/api.js`; the user id always comes from the session, never the client. Client: `src/services/auth.js` (Better Auth React client) and `src/pages/Account.jsx`. Every transaction (create/change/cancel) must call `requireUser`; only read-only browsing is public, and cancel/modify are scoped to the owner's `user_id`. No email verification or password reset (no mail sender).
